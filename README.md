# QuoridorZero
Using AlphaZero methodology to develop an AI for the game of Quoridor.


____________
### Note
The actual AI has been moved to my [mcts](https://github.com/mattdeak/mcts) repo. It can integrate with any environment that meets certain criteria, thus this repo is now just a Quoridor game environment.
